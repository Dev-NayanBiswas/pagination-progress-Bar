1. _Here i got few Circles, 2-buttons and a progress-Bar; the Logic is to add (active)/remove(active) class on each click of these 2-buttons based on a static value ***"turnTimes"***, button ***prev*** will decrease and ***next*** will increase the value, thing is that, the value can't be less then ***One*** and greater then the value of ***circle.length***. In this part..._
```javascript
// cause circle is an array of group of elements so it has a length. . .
const circle = document.querySelectorAll(".circle");

let turnTimes = 1;

next.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    turnTimes++;
    if(turnTimes>circle.length){
        turnTimes=circle.length;
    }
    // console.log(turnTimes);
    updateDOM();
})

prev.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    turnTimes--;
    if(turnTimes<1){
        turnTimes=1;
    }
    // console.log(turnTimes);
    updateDOM();
})
```
_If turnTimes is greater than ***circle.length*** then reassigning it's value with ***circle.length***_
_and if it's lesser than 1! then reassigning it's  value as ***1***. Cause I won't go lesser then one or greater then numbers of elements ***(circle.length)***. . ._
_every time I clicked on any button, need to update the DOM so I called a function ***updateDOM()*** which will do the rest_



2. _in the 1st part of this Function I'am looping trough the circle array with forEach loop, where I'am getting every individual ***circle*** and its Index as second parameter, and checking, the index is lesser then turnTimes or not? and conditionally adding or removing ***active*** class,_
   _cause every time i clicked on a button either increasing or decreasing the static value of ***turnTimes***, like when I click on next button it will increase the value +1 every time and will call ***updateDOM()*** function, then updateDOM will get ***turnTimes=2*** and ***(index < turnTimes)*** is ***index=1***, as condition it will enter the ***if(){}*** part, and will add active class to the 1st index element which is circle2 ***[0,1,2,3 index starts from 0]*** and we will see active CSS on circle 2, ***(can't go for index 0 cause it's already activated by default and conditionally prev button will be disabled before signing it )***_ðŸ˜Ž
   ```javascript
    function updateDOM(){

    // Looping Through Every circle items and searching which one got 
    //the less index value compare with state value? and Update the DOM... 
    circle.forEach((elem, index)=>{
        if(index<turnTimes){
            elem.classList.add("active");
        }
        else{
            elem.classList.remove("active");
        }
    })

    updateCss()
    enableAndDisable();
    }
    ```
_if **turnTimes** value is 5 (means it's 4th index element got the active class and got the css style on UI) and user hits the **prev** button, it will decrease **turnTimes** value -1 that means turnTimes=4 ***(turnTimes = 4 > index = 4, that's not possible, so if condition won't match, as result it will execute else condition)***, so **updateDom()** will remove active class from ***index 4*** element, and it will lose it's CSS style.._



 3. _***updateDom()*** will call 2functions ***enableAndDisable()*** and ***updateCss()*** functions, enableDisable function will check, is the turnTimes value is equal to ***"1"*** or equal to ***circle.length*** or not! If it's equal to one, then no need to go further less so it will disabled the ***prev*** button and if the turnTime is equal to ***circle.length***, then no need to go further long, as it will disable the ***next*** button on that time, if the turnTimes value won't match both conditions then both button will remain visible and active_

```javascript
function enableAndDisable(){
    // Here enabling the disabled button and disabling enable on conditions. . . 
    if(turnTimes===1){
        prev.disabled=true;
    }
    else if(turnTimes===circle.length){
        next.disabled=true;    
    }
    else{
        prev.disabled=false;
        next.disabled=false;
    }
}
```






1. _**updateDOM** called this **updateCSS()** function to add ***width*** style based on **percentage(%)** of ***active*** classes elements and total numbers of elements ***circle.length***, I slightly tone it down a little to get a lesser percentage_

```javascript
function updateCss(){
     let activeCircle = document.querySelectorAll(".active");
     progressBar.style.width= ((activeCircle.length -1) / (circle.length -1))*100+"%" ;
}
```
